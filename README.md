# Gravity Gradient Stabilization of Objects in Polar and Equatorial Orbits (Matlab)

This project focuses on the study and analysis of gravity gradient stabilization of objects in polar and equatorial orbits using Matlab. The aim is to understand the dynamics of the system and to simulate its behavior using numerical methods.

The repository contains Matlab code to perform simulations of objects in polar and equatorial orbits under the influence of gravity gradient. The simulations include the modeling of the orbit and the calculation of the gravity gradient forces acting on the object. The results of the simulations are presented through plots and animations to aid in the visualization of the dynamics of the system.

The code in this repository is intended to be used as a tool for understanding the behavior of objects in polar and equatorial orbits under gravity gradient stabilization. The repository is open for contributions and improvements from the community, and we welcome feedback and suggestions.

## Prograde and Retrograde Precession

Prograde and retrograde precession are important phenomena in the stabilization of objects using gravity gradient. Prograde precession occurs when the rotation of the object causes it to precess in the same direction as its orbit. This can be used to stabilize objects in equatorial orbits. Retrograde precession, on the other hand, occurs when the rotation of the object causes it to precess in the opposite direction as its orbit. This can be used to stabilize objects in polar orbits. Understanding the effect of precession on the stability of objects in orbit is crucial in the design and operation of satellites and other objects in space. The code in this repository includes simulations of both prograde and retrograde precession, allowing for a better understanding of the dynamics of the system under different conditions.
